# Privacy Policy for resizeimage.dev

Your privacy is critically important to us. At resizeimage.dev, we have a fundamental principle: **your data is your own**. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information, or more accurately, how we are committed to *not* handling your sensitive information.
</Header>

## The Golden Rule: Your Files Never Leave Your Computer

Unlike many other online tools, **resizeimage.dev operates entirely within your web browser**. This is called "client-side processing."

What this means for you:

- **Your images are NEVER uploaded to our servers.**
- We do not, and cannot, see, copy, or store the images you process.
- All the magic of resizing, compressing, and converting happens locally on your own device.

This makes our Service as secure as any desktop software you might install on your computer. Your privacy is structurally guaranteed.

## Information We Collect (and Why)

Because our tool runs on the client-side, we collect significantly less data than a typical web service.

### Personal Information

We do not require you to create an account, log in, or provide any personal information such as your name or email address to use our core service.

### The Images You Process

To be unequivocally clear: **we do not collect your images**. They are opened directly into your browser, processed, and you download them back to your computer. They never touch a server owned or operated by us.

### Usage Data (Analytics)

To understand how our Service is used and to make it better, we collect anonymous, aggregated usage data. This is done through standard analytics services like Google Analytics.

This data may include:

- Your browser type and version (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- The pages you visit on our site.
- The time and date of your visit and the time spent on pages.
- General diagnostic data to help us find and fix bugs.

This data is anonymized and cannot be used to personally identify you. We use it solely to improve the user experience and functionality of the website.

### Cookies and Tracking Technologies for Advertising

Our Service is supported by advertising, and we use Google AdSense to serve ads. Google AdSense is an advertising service provided by Google LLC.

- **Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to our Website or other websites.**
- Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our Website and/or other sites on the Internet.
- **You may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting Google's [Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads).**

Alternatively, you can opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies for personalized advertising by visiting [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info).

## Children's Privacy

Our Service is not intended for anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with any information, please contact us, and we will take steps to address it.

## Links to Other Websites

Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date at the top.

You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes are effective when they are posted on this page.
