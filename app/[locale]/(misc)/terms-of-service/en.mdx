## 1. Use of Service

Our Service provides users with the ability to process image files (such as resizing, compressing, and converting) directly within their web browser. The Service is free to use.

You agree not to use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose, including but not limited to:

- Processing images that infringe on any copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights.

## 2. Intellectual Property and User Content

**You retain 100% ownership and all rights to any images you process through our Service.**

Our Service operates entirely on the client-side, meaning your images are never uploaded to, stored on, or viewed by our servers. We have no claim, right, or access to your content. You are solely responsible for the content you choose to process.

## 3. Disclaimer of Warranties

The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We make no warranties, express or implied, that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or completely secure. While we strive for high quality and accuracy, we do not guarantee the results of any processing, and you use the Service at your own risk.

## 4. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall resizeimage.dev, its owners, or affiliates be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages (including but not limited to, loss of data or profit, or business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the Service, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damage.

## 5. Advertising

Our Service is supported by advertising, including Google AdSense. By using the Service, you agree to the placement of advertising on the website. The privacy implications of this advertising are covered in our Privacy Policy.

## 6. Changes to Terms

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify users of any changes by posting the new Terms on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. Your continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.
